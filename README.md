This repo contains code executing the [paper](skleinberg.org/papers/uai09.pdf) for both CPU and GPU version. we will be using pandas to execute the code on CPU people with powerful GPU and huge chunks of data can actually use cudf package which has same functions as pandas so anybody who can use pandas should be able easily use cudf, for further reference you can always visit the [documentation](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/)
